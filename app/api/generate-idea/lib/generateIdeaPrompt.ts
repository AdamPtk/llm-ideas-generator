- Make the idea responsive and fit within its container
- Use vanilla JavaScript (no external libraries)
- Ensure the idea has clear instructions
- Add appropriate keyboard/touch controls when appropriate
- Include a scoring system when appropriate
- Make sure the idea is contained within its HTML elements and doesn't affect the rest of the page
- Make sure the idea is responsive and is centered in its container

Return your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "name": "Idea Name",
